This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app), with some added boilerplate features pre-installed.

## Added Files

- _app.js has loading events detected and displays components accordingly.
- A basic Loading.js component is included
- A custom _document.js file is included so that Html language can be set manually.
- A Layout.js file wraps the components, and the Head and Footer elements are included there. 

## Sass Files

- The beginnings of a Sass file structure are included.
- Font imports and variables have their own file, as do other global variables.

Simply clone the repo and run `npm install`
